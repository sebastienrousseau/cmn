//! ## Overview ðŸ“–
//!
//! `Common (CMN)` is a modern, fast, and user-friendly library that makes it easy to access a wide range of mathematical and cryptographic constants.
//!
//! ## Features âœ¨
//!
//! The `Common (CMN)` uses the `serde` crate to serialize and deserialize the data.
//!
//! The library has three modules:
//!
//! - **Macros**: This module contains functions for generating macros that can be used to access the constants.
//! - **Constants**: This module contains the Constants structure, which provides a collection of constant values that are used throughout the library.
//! - **Words**: This module contains the Words structure, which provides a collection of words that are used throughout the library.
//!
//! ### Mathematical and Cryptographic Constants
//!
//! The following table lists the most important mathematical and cryptographic constants available in the `Common (CMN)` library:
//!
//!| Constants | Description | Example |
//!| --- | --- | --- |
//!| AVOGADRO | Avogadro's constant is the number of atoms or molecules in one mole of a substance. | The number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 is 6.02214076 Ã— 10^23. This can be used to calculate the number of atoms or molecules in a given sample. |
//!| BOLTZMANN | Boltzmann's constant is the physical constant relating the temperature of a system to the average kinetic energy of its constituent particles. | The kinetic energy of an atom at room temperature is about 2.0 Ã— 10^-21 joules. This can be used to calculate the temperature of a system, or to calculate the average kinetic energy of its particles. |
//!| EULER | Euler's constant is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. | The sum of the infinite series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... is equal to Euler's constant, e. This can be used to calculate the sum of an infinite series, or to calculate the logarithm of a number. |
//!| GAMMA | The gamma constant is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 0.57721. | The gamma function of 2 is equal to 1. This can be used to calculate the gamma function of a number, or to calculate the factorial of a number. |
//!| HASH_ALGORITHM | The hash algorithm used to generate the hash. The default is Blake3. | The hash of the string "Hello, world!" is 5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc32790160b123138d53f2173b8d3dc3eee. This can be used to verify the integrity of data, or to create a unique identifier for a file. |
//!| HASH_COST | The cost of the hash. | The hash cost of Blake3 is 2^128. This can be used to determine how secure a hash algorithm is. |
//!| HASH_LENGTH | The length of the hash. | The hash length of Blake3 is 32 bytes. This can be used to determine how much space is required to store the hash output. |
//!| PHI | The golden ratio is a number approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. | The golden ratio can be used to create a symmetrical design, or a design that is pleasing to the eye. |
//!| PI | Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. | The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to pi. This can be used to calculate the circumference, area, and volume of circles, spheres, and other geometric shapes. |
//!| PLANCK | Planck's constant is a physical constant that is approximately equal to 6.62607015 Ã— 10^âˆ’34 joule seconds. | The energy of a photon of light with a wavelength of 500 nanometers is equal to Planck's constant multiplied by the frequency of the light. This can be used to calculate the energy of photons and other elementary particles. |
//!| SILVER_RATIO | The silver ratio is a number approximately equal to 1.414213562373095. | The silver ratio can be used to create a symmetrical design, or a design that is pleasing to the eye. |
//!| SPECIAL_CHARS | A list of special characters. | The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|\:;"'<>,.? |
//!| SQRT2 | The square root of 2 is a number approximately equal to 1.414213562373095. | The area of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to the square root of 2. This can be used to calculate the area and volume of circles, spheres, and other geometric shapes. |
//!| SQRT3 | The square root of 3 is a number approximately equal to 1.732050807568877. | The area of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to the square root of 3. This can be used to calculate the area and volume of circles
//!| SQRT5 | The square root of 5 is a number approximately equal to 2.23606797749979. | The area of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to the square root of 5. |
//!| TAU | Tau is a number approximately equal to 6.283185307179586. | The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to tau. |
//!
//! The following table lists the dictionaries available in the Common
//! library.
//!
//!| Words | Description |
//!| --- | --- |
//!| `words` | Contains a dictionary of common words. |
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Common can be any `serde::Serialize` or `serde::Deserialize` types
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//!
//! // Import the Common libraries
//! extern crate cmn;
//! use cmn::Constants;
//! use cmn::Words;
//!
//! // Constants
//! let constants = Constants::new();
//! let constant = constants.constant("EULER");
//! assert_eq!(constant.unwrap().name, "EULER");
//!
//! // Words
//! let words = Words::new();
//! let words_list = words.words_list();
//! assert_eq!(words_list[0], "aboard");

## Overview üìñ

`Common (CMN)` is a modern, fast, and user-friendly library that makes it easy to access a wide range of mathematical and cryptographic constants.

## Features ‚ú®

The `Common (CMN)` uses the `serde` crate to serialize and deserialize the data.

The library has three modules:

- **Macros**: This module contains functions for generating macros that can be used to access the constants and words.
- **Constants**: This module contains the `Constants` structure, which provides a collection of constant values that are used throughout the library.
- **Words**: This module contains the `Words` structure, which provides a collection of words that are used throughout the library.

### Mathematical and Cryptographic Constants

The following table lists the most important mathematical and cryptographic constants available in the `Common (CMN)` library:

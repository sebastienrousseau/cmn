## Overview üìñ

`Common (CMN)`, a Rust library designed for developers who are looking for a comprehensive collection of mathematical and cryptographic constants.

`Common (CMN)` is a modern, fast, and user-friendly library that makes it easy to access a wide range of mathematical and cryptographic constants, including the mathematical constant `Euler`, the `hash` algorithm used, the `cost` of the hash algorithm, the `length` of the hash, the mathematical constant `Phi`, the mathematical constant `Pi`, the `Planck` constant, a set of `special` characters, and much more.

## Features ‚ú®

The library includes two main structures: `Constant` and `Constants`.

- The `Constant` structure holds the name and value of each constant as
a `&'static str` and a `String`, respectively.
- The Constants structure implements a method constants that returns a
`Vec<Constant>` containing all the available constants.
- The available constants include the mathematical constants `EULER`,
`PHI`, `PI`, `PLANCK`, and `SQRT5`, and the cryptographic constants
`HASH_ALGORITHM`, `HASH_COST`, `HASH_LENGTH`, and `SPECIAL_CHARS`.
- The library also includes an enumeration `ConstantValue` that
represents the different constant values. The values can be an
`f64 float`, a `String`, a `u32`, a `usize`, or a `&'static [char]`
array of characters.

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `Common (CMN)`.

### Installation

To install `Common (CMN)`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the instructions on the [Rust website][14].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `Common (CMN)` using the following command:

```shell
cargo install cmn
```

You can then run the help command to see the available options:

```shell
cmn --help
```

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust **1.69.0** or later (stable). It is recommended that you install the latest stable version of Rust.

### Platform support

`Common (CMN)` is supported and tested on the following platforms:

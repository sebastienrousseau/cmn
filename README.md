## Overview üìñ

`Common (CMN)` is a modern, fast, and user-friendly library that makes it easy to access a wide range of mathematical and cryptographic constants.

## Features ‚ú®

The `Common (CMN)` uses the `serde` crate to serialize and deserialize the data.

The library has three modules:

- **Macros**: This module contains functions for generating macros that can be used to access the constants.
- **Constants**: This module contains the Constants structure, which provides a collection of constant values that are used throughout the library.
- **Words**: This module contains the Words structure, which provides a collection of words that are used throughout the library.

### Mathematical and Cryptographic Constants

The following table lists the most important mathematical and cryptographic constants available in the `Common (CMN)` library:

| Constants | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AVOGADRO | Avogadro's constant is the number of atoms or molecules in one mole of a substance. | The number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 is 6.02214076 √ó 10^23. This can be used to calculate the number of atoms or molecules in a given sample. |
| BOLTZMANN | Boltzmann's constant is the physical constant relating the temperature of a system to the average kinetic energy of its constituent particles. | The kinetic energy of an atom at room temperature is about 2.0 √ó 10^-21 joules. This can be used to calculate the temperature of a system, or to calculate the average kinetic energy of its particles. |
| EULER | Euler's constant is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. | The sum of the infinite series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... is equal to Euler's constant, e. This can be used to calculate the sum of an infinite series, or to calculate the logarithm of a number. |
| GAMMA | The gamma constant is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 0.57721. | The gamma function of 2 is equal to 1. This can be used to calculate the gamma function of a number, or to calculate the factorial of a number. |
| HASH_ALGORITHM | The hash algorithm used to generate the hash. The default is Blake3. | The hash of the string "Hello, world!" is 5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc32790160b123138d53f2173b8d3dc3eee. This can be used to verify the integrity of data, or to create a unique identifier for a file. |
| HASH_COST | The cost of the hash. | The hash cost of Blake3 is 2^128. This can be used to determine how secure a hash algorithm is. |
| HASH_LENGTH | The length of the hash. | The hash length of Blake3 is 32 bytes. This can be used to determine how much space is required to store the hash output. |
| PHI | The golden ratio is a number approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. | The golden ratio can be used to create a symmetrical design, or a design that is pleasing to the eye. |
| Pi (œÄ) | Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. | The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to pi. This can be used to calculate the circumference, area, and volume of circles, spheres, and other geometric shapes. |
| PLANCK | Planck's constant is a physical constant that is approximately equal to 6.62607015 √ó 10^‚àí34 joule seconds. | The energy of a photon of light with a wavelength of 500 nanometers is equal to Planck's constant multiplied by the frequency of the light. This can be used to calculate the energy of photons and other elementary particles. |
| SILVER_RATIO | The silver ratio is a number approximately equal to 1.414213562373095. | The silver ratio can be used to create a symmetrical design, or a design that is pleasing to the eye. |
| SPECIAL_CHARS | A list of special characters. | The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|\:;"'<>,.? |
| SQRT2 | The square root of 2 is a number approximately equal to 1.414213562373095. | The area of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to the square root of 2. This can be used to calculate the area and volume of circles, spheres, and other geometric shapes. |
| SQRT3 | The square root of 3 is a number approximately equal to 1.732050807568877. | The area of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to the square root of 3. This can be used to calculate the area and volume of circles
| SQRT5 | The square root of 5 is a number approximately equal to 2.23606797749979. | The area of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to the square root of 5. |
| TAU | Tau is a number approximately equal to 6.283185307179586. | The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 is equal to tau. |

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `Common (CMN)`.

### Installation
